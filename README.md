# Tarificator

This is my first C++ project strated at middle 90s...

The purpose is to control payments and access of compiter clubs and internet cafe's with flexible tarification plans.

The code is provided as is, for historical reasons. But if you want to use it or make refactoring according to new technologies and C++ standards, feel free to fork / clone.

Co-author and PO of the project - @ADDubovik
